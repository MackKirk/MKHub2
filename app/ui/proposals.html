1. PARTIES & GENERAL INFORMATION
This document outlines the binding agreement between Mack Kirk (hereafter referred to as "Contractor") and the Client (hereafter referred to as "Owner" or "Buyer") for commercial project services. The scope of this contract may include roof repairs, replacements, restorations, inspections, or other construction services, as outlined in the attached proposal. By proceeding with any aspect of the work or delivery of materials, the Owner agrees to all terms and conditions within this document, which supersedes any conflicting terms not expressly agreed upon in writing. Both parties affirm that they possess the authority to enter into this agreement and agree to collaborate professionally and transparently throughout the project timeline. The laws governing this agreement shall be those of the Province of British Columbia, and any disputes will be resolved within its jurisdiction.

2. OWNER INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
For effective communication and project execution, the Owner must provide accurate information, including legal company name, primary and secondary contacts, contact emails and phone numbers, billing address and billing contact, property address, on-site project contact, and relevant details such as roof type, size, age, levels, and existing system information. Site-specific notes are also required. Failure to provide complete information may result in project delays or additional charges.

3. ACCEPTANCE OF PROPOSAL
By permitting Mack Kirk to begin work or deliver materials to the job site, the Owner accepts this proposal and these Terms and Conditions - even in the absence of a physical signature. Any alternate or conflicting terms presented by the Owner via PO systems or custom agreements shall be considered subordinate to this document unless explicitly accepted in writing by Mack Kirk.

4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This agreement, along with its attachments and referenced documents, constitutes the full and complete understanding between the parties. All prior discussions, written or oral, are merged into this agreement. Any amendment must be in writing and signed by both parties.

5. STRUCTURAL LOADING DISCLAIMER
The Owner acknowledges that the proposed work, especially roofing systems, may add weight to the building structure. Mack Kirk is not responsible for conducting structural evaluations and assumes no liability for related issues. It is the Owner's sole responsibility to confirm structural capacity before work begins.

6. SCOPE OF WORK & SITE-SPECIFIC SAFETY PLAN
Mack Kirk will perform all services in accordance with the outlined proposal, applicable building codes, and industry best practices. A Site-Specific Safety Plan will be developed prior to mobilization. This plan includes pre-work hazard inspections, custom safety briefings, enforcement of personal protective equipment (PPE), implementation of fall protection and roof edge safety systems, defined emergency protocols, and regular compliance audits. The Owner must ensure unobstructed access to the job site and provide staging space, port-a-john placement, and material storage if applicable.

7. CHANGE ORDERS & SCOPE EXCLUSIONS
Any change to the originally agreed-upon scope of work requires written authorization via a signed Change Order. The Owner must update any internal PO or project tracking system within 24 hours of approving a change. Mack Kirk reserves the right to pause work on the affected portion of the project until this is complete. Exclusions to the original scope of work include, but are not limited to, rotten decking replacement, decking repairs (plywood, steel, or wood), hazardous material abatement, mechanical, electrical, or plumbing repairs, interior protection or cleanup, correction of nail pops, overtime or weekend labor, and crane rental for additional work unless explicitly included.

8. HVAC, ELECTRICAL, AND UTILITIES
The Owner is responsible for all fees, coordination, and scheduling related to HVAC, satellite, and utility disconnection or reconnection. Mack Kirk will not adjust or recalibrate equipment. Notification of inactive or decommissioned systems should be provided in advance to avoid disruption.

9. DRAWINGS & VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS
All schematic drawings included in proposals are illustrative and may be modified as necessary based on site conditions or feasibility. Final installation methods are determined at Mack Kirk's discretion in accordance with manufacturer requirements and professional standards.

10. PROTECTION OF WORK
Mack Kirk is responsible for protecting the job site and roofing system during the installation phase. Prior to and after this period, all responsibility shifts to the Owner and/or other contractors on site. Damage caused by other trades or events outside Mack Kirk's control is not covered by warranty and will be invoiced to the Owner.

11. MATERIALS & EQUIPMENT HANDLING
Mack Kirk will use certified operators and insured equipment including hoists, delivery trucks, and disposal bins. Material will be staged either at-grade or on the roof, depending on site logistics and safety. The Owner agrees to provide reasonable access and staging areas to facilitate efficient material handling.

12. PAYMENT SCHEDULE & FINANCIAL TERMS
Payments are due upon receipt of invoice. A late charge of 1.5% per month (18% annually) will apply to unpaid balances after 30 days. Mack Kirk may place a lien on the property for nonpayment and pursue all legal remedies. All collection fees, attorney fees, and court costs will be the Owner's responsibility.

13. WARRANTY & PERFORMANCE COMMITMENT
All work will be completed in accordance with contract documents and manufacturer guidelines. Upon full payment, Mack Kirk will issue a warranty certificate outlining duration and coverage and provide a proposal for the future service of the roof. Warranty exclusions include damage caused by unrelated trades, vandalism, severe weather, natural disasters, deferred maintenance, or negligence.

14. LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
Mack Kirk is liable only for direct physical damage resulting from proven negligence. No liability is assumed for indirect, consequential, economic, or punitive damages including loss of rent, business disruption, or inconvenience. Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Mack Kirk from claims arising from acts of third parties or unforeseen events.

15. INSURANCE
Mack Kirk maintains current general liability, vehicle, and Workers' Compensation insurance. Certificates can be furnished upon request. The Owner is responsible for property insurance covering the entire value of the structure, including the roof, until full contract payment has been made.

16. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
Mack Kirk does not conduct environmental testing or hazardous material abatement. The Owner is responsible for pre-project identification of asbestos, mold, or other hazardous conditions. If discovered during the project, work will halt until remediation is complete at the Owner's expense.

17. DRAINAGE, SPRINKLER & CONDUIT RISKS
Roof work may affect hidden or embedded systems. Mack Kirk is not liable for unintentional damage to internal drains or plumbing, sprinkler systems, electrical conduits, or telecom cabling. Clients are encouraged to disclose known risks and arrange inspections where needed.

18. PROJECT TIMELINES & DELAYS
Estimated start and completion dates will be provided, but are subject to change due to weather, material delays, permit approvals, or force majeure. Mack Kirk commits to clear and prompt communication in the event of delays and to rescheduling in a manner that minimizes project disruption.

19. COMMUNICATION & SITE ACCESS
The Owner will identify a designated on-site contact to facilitate timely communication, authorize decisions, and coordinate site access. Mack Kirk's teams will not be responsible for delays caused by restricted access or lack of timely decisions from the Owner's side.

20. MARKETING USE
The Owner grants Mack Kirk permission to feature photographs or general project descriptions for marketing purposes, excluding pricing and identifying property details unless written permission is granted.

21. TERMINATION
Either party may terminate this agreement with written notice if the other materially breaches its obligations. The Contractor may also suspend or terminate work if payments are not made as agreed, or if hazardous conditions arise. The Owner will be responsible for all completed work, mobilization fees, and demobilization costs up to the point of termination.

22. GOVERNING LAW
This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Any disputes shall be settled in a court of competent jurisdiction within that province.
By signing the accompanying proposal, the Owner agrees to these Terms and Conditions in full. For questions or clarification, please contact your Mack Kirk project representative.
